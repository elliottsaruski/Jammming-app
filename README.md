# Jamming - A React-based Spotify Playlist Creator

## Purpose
Jammming is a web application built with React and Vite that allows users to search for music by song name on Spotify and create playlists. The primary purpose of this project is to provide users with a seamless and interactive experience for creating quick Spotify playlists and saving them to their account.

## Technologies Used
- **React:** The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** The project is also built with Vite, an opinionated web dev build tool that serves code via native ES Module imports during development.
- **Spotify API:** The application interacts with the Spotify API to search for tracks and create playlists.
- **CSS:** Custom styles are applied to enhance the user interface and provide a visually appealing experience.

## Features
1. **Search for Tracks:** Users can enter a search query, and the application fetches and displays relevant tracks from Spotify.
2. **Create Playlists:** Users can create playlists, add tracks from search results, and save the playlists to their Spotify account.
3. **Playlist Management:** Users can view, name, and manage their playlists, including adding and removing tracks.

## How to Use
1. Log-in to your Spotify Account and Authorize access for "Jammming".
2. Name your custom Playlist in the Playlist section.
3. Search for a song by Song Name and hit the "Search" button.
4. Add Songs to custom Playlist with the "+" button.
5. Remove Songs from custom Playlist with the "-" button.
6. Save custom Playlist to your Spotify Account with the "Save to Spotify" button (custom Playlist Name should be set  beforehand).

## Future Work
- **Additional Functionalities:** Allow users to change their search query filter from "Song Names" to allow the user to search by other attributes like artistâ€™s name, genre, etc.
- **Improved Playlist Interactions:** Enhance playlist features, such as reordering tracks.
- **User Feedback:** Implement more user feedback features, such as loading spinners and error messages.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure a seamless experience across various screen sizes and devices.

## Development Tools
- **prop-types:** Used for specifying the expected data types of React component props.
- **axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to external APIs - in this case, the Spotify API.
- **prettier:** Code formatter used to maintain a consistent coding style across project.
- **Git:** Hosts repository and handles Version control.
- **Netlify:** Builds, deploys, and hosts serverless backend services for "Jammming".
- **VSCode:** Visual Studio Code was used as the IDE for writing and managing the "Jammming" app codebase.
- **ChatGPT:** Used for answering development-related questions and assisting in various programming tasks. **(Please note that the AI model is not a direct part of the project's technology stack but has been utilized as a supplementary tool for providing assistance when stackoverflow.com and/or docs could not help solve an issue.)**
